# Mining Rewards System Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Statement (ပြသာနာ)

Mining rewards were not being credited to user balances after 24 hours because:
1. The `scheduleRewards()` function used `setInterval()` which only worked while the server was running
2. When the server restarted, all pending intervals were lost
3. Users who staked 24+ hours ago weren't receiving their daily rewards

## Solution Implemented (ဆောင်ရွက်ချက်)

### 1. **New Mining Settlement Function** - `settleDueMiningRewards()`

Added a persistent settlement function in `server.js` that:

#### Features:
- ✅ Runs every 60 seconds (piggybacks on existing arbitrage settlement schedule)
- ✅ Processes mining records that are **24+ hours old** since last income update
- ✅ Automatically credits daily rewards to user's ETH balance
- ✅ Updates mining record with new `totalIncome`, `todayIncome`, and `lastIncomeAt`
- ✅ Runs on server startup to catch all overdue rewards
- ✅ Survives server restarts (persistent across restarts)

#### Location in server.js:
```
Lines 715-787: settleDueMiningRewards() function
Lines 75-80: Added to settlement trigger (runs every 60 seconds)
Lines 82-85: Added to immediate startup settlement
```

### 2. **How It Works**

**Calculation Logic:**
```javascript
hoursSinceLastUpdate = (now - lastIncomeAt) / (1000 * 60 * 60)

IF hoursSinceLastUpdate >= 24:
   dailyReward = stakedAmount * dailyYield
   user.balances.eth += dailyReward
   miningRecord.totalIncome += dailyReward
   miningRecord.todayIncome = dailyReward
   miningRecord.lastIncomeAt = now
```

**Settlement Schedule:**
- Immediate on server startup: Process all overdue records
- Every 60 seconds: Continuous settlement check
- On each new mining order: Plus the existing `scheduleRewards()` interval

### 3. **Example Timeline**

For a user with:
- `stakedAmount`: 20 ETH
- `dailyYield`: 0.005 (0.5%)
- `startDate`: 2025-12-03 21:57:12 UTC
- `dailyReward`: 20 × 0.005 = **0.1 ETH**

| Time | Action | todayIncome | totalIncome |
|------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025-12-03 21:57:12 | Stake created | 0 | 0 |
| 2025-12-04 21:57:12+ | Settlement runs | 0.1 | 0.1 |
| 2025-12-05 21:57:12+ | Settlement runs again | 0.1 | 0.2 |
| After server restart | Settlement runs immediately | 0.1 | 0.3 |

### 4. **Frontend Display**

The frontend already handles the display correctly:

**mining.html** - Shows summary stats (refreshes every 30 seconds):
```javascript
fetchMiningStats() → /api/Mine/getminesy
- Displays: total_jine (total income), recent_jine (today income)
- Auto-refreshes: Every 30 seconds
```

**mining-record.html** - Shows individual staking records:
```javascript
loadMore() → /api/Mine/records/:userid
- Displays each record with: amount, status, startDate, todayIncome
- Shows "Earning" badge if todayIncome > 0
```

### 5. **Data Flow**

```
Mining Staking Created (setmineorder)
         ↓
    1. User balance deducted
    2. Mining record created with startDate
    3. scheduleRewards() interval started
         ↓
After 24 hours:
         ↓
    Option A: scheduleRewards() interval fires (if server running)
    Option B: settleDueMiningRewards() catches it (on restart or periodic check)
         ↓
    1. Daily reward calculated
    2. User ETH balance increased
    3. Mining record updated (totalIncome, todayIncome, lastIncomeAt)
    4. Changes saved to JSON files
         ↓
Frontend refreshes every 30 seconds:
         ↓
/api/Mine/getminesy returns updated totalIncome & todayIncome
```

### 6. **Testing the Fix**

#### Test Case 1: Recent Staking (< 24 hours)
```
User stakes 10 ETH at 2025-12-05 08:00:00
Server restarts at 2025-12-05 10:00:00 (2 hours later)
Result: ✅ No settlement yet (waiting for 24 hours)
```

#### Test Case 2: Overdue Staking (> 24 hours, no settlement yet)
```
User stakes 10 ETH at 2025-12-03 08:00:00
Server restarts at 2025-12-04 10:00:00 (26+ hours later)
Result: ✅ Settlement runs immediately!
  - dailyReward = 10 * dailyYield calculated
  - User balance increased
  - todayIncome updated
  - totalIncome increased
```

#### Test Case 3: Multiple Settlements
```
User stakes 10 ETH at 2025-12-01 08:00:00
- 24h later (2025-12-02): Settlement #1 = +reward
- 48h later (2025-12-03): Settlement #2 = +reward
- Server restart: Settlement #3 = +reward
Result: ✅ totalIncome accumulates: reward + reward + reward
```

### 7. **Admin Monitoring**

View all mining records and their settlement status:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/admin/mining-records
```

Check individual records:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/Mine/records/:userid
```

### 8. **Console Logs for Debugging**

Watch settlement in real-time:
```
[MINING SETTLEMENT] Settled reward for user 37282:
  reward: 0.1000000
  newBalance: 100.1000000
  orderId: 8ff21db8-4b79-47a1-9b31-d1c8e2ea933c

[MINING SETTLEMENT] Updates saved to files
```

## Files Modified (ပြင်ဆင်ထားသည့်ဖိုင်များ)

1. **server.js**
   - Lines 75-85: Added `settleDueMiningRewards()` to settlement scheduler
   - Lines 715-787: Added complete `settleDueMiningRewards()` function

## Database Files (မြန်မာ)

The system uses JSON file persistence (no database):

- `mining_records.json` - Updated with reward amounts
- `users.json` - Updated with ETH balance increases

## Backward Compatibility ✅

- ✅ Existing `scheduleRewards()` continues to work for active sessions
- ✅ Frontend displays remain unchanged
- ✅ API endpoints remain unchanged
- ✅ All mining records maintain compatibility

## Summary of Changes

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Settlement | Only if server running | Persistent + on every restart |
| Timing | Every 24h if interval exists | Every 60s settlement check |
| Lost Rewards | ❌ Yes, on restart | ✅ No, caught on startup |
| Daily Income Display | ❌ Not updating | ✅ Updates every 30s |
| Total Income | ❌ Not accumulating | ✅ Accumulates correctly |

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

**Deployment**: Ready for production
- No dependencies added
- No database changes needed
- Pure Node.js file-based settlement
